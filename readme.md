# About

- This website is hosted on a Ubuntu 14.04 Digital Ocean Droplet. 
- It uses Nginx, Phusion Passenger and Ruby on Rails. 
- The blog is rendered by the [personal blog gem](rubygems.org/gems/personal_blog) I created. 
- It also uses RVM to manage Ruby versions. 
- I'm currently dockerizing my setup to make it feel all isolated and clean and nice! (And give me the ability to ditch Digital Ocean for AWS maybe..)
